## Stake dapp

### Backend

In the directory hardhat, you can deploy the contract, then wait anyone to stake, if the staked balances bigger than the threshold, and the block time bigger than the deadline, then everyone can excute to send the balance to the second contract; if the balances is smaller than the threshold, then anyone can withdraw their eth.

### Frontend

In the next-app directory, you can trace the balances staked, and execute or withdraw with the button.
